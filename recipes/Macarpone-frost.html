    <h2>Not my sister's mascarpone frosting on a cupycake <3</h2>
    <p>Everyone knows how to make a frosting, but does everyone knows how to make a banana <strong>frosting</strong> out of Mascarpone ? Absolutly not, and Haruki Murakami is one of the proof.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>600ml Heavy cream, I think</li>
        <li>140g Mascarpone</li>
        <li>2tsp Vanilla</li>
        <li>2 Large eggs</li>
        <li>Sugar, as much as you want</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix sugar + zest and the eggs</li>
        <li>Add rest off the ingredients and bake for <strong>45/50 min</strong></li>
        <li>Boil the sugar and juice and pour on the baked cake</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Crazy right when you know how to make a lemon cake, you can make anything !</p>
